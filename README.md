# intro-project

## Objective
This project will involve creating a ros package that uses turtlesim. The objective is to create a simulation where one turtle is controlled by the user (using turtle_teleop_key) and the other turtle follows the controlled turtle. An idea of what this would look like can be seen below where the green turtle is controlled using turtle_teleop_key and the white turtle follows the green turtle.

## Resources
In order to complete this task a basic understanding of ROS is required. The begginer tutorials (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) should provide you with the fundemental concepts and give you practice with some of the ros packages/nodes you will use in this project (turtlesim, turtle_teleop_key, etc.). The ROS Navigation tutorials (http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials) may also contain some helpful information for this challenge.

## Submission
In order to submit your project, please create a new branch on this repository that contains your entire catkin workspace (initialize the git repository at 'build', 'devel', 'src' level).
